				<h3 epub:type="title">Passion, Poison and Petrifaction</h3>
				<p>In a bed-sitting room in a fashionable quarter of London a <per>lady</per> sits at her dressing-table, with her maid combing her hair. It is late. and the electric lamps are glowing. Apparently the room is bedless, but there stands against the opposite wall to that at which the dressing-table is placed a piece of furniture that suggests a bookcase without carrying conviction. On the same side is a chest of drawers of that disastrous kind which, recalcitrant to the opener until she is provoked to violence, then suddenly come wholly out and defy all her efforts to fit them in again. Opposite this chest of drawers, on the <per>lady’s</per> side of the room, is a cupboard. The presence of a row of gentleman’s boots beside the chest of drawers proclaims that the <per>lady</per> is married. Her own boots are beside the cupboard. The third wall is pierced midway by the door, above which is a cuckoo clock. Near the door a pedestal bears a portrait bust of the lady in plaster. There is a fan on the dressing-table, a hatbox and rug strap on the chest of drawers, an umbrella and a bootjack against the wall near the bed. The general impression is one of brightness, beauty, and social ambition, damped by somewhat inadequate means. A certain air of theatricality is produced by the fact that though the room is rectangular it has only three walls. Not a sound is heard except the overture and the crackling of the <per>lady’s</per> hair as the maid’s brush draws electric sparks from it in the dry air of the London midsummer. The cuckoo clock strikes sixteen.</p>

They sing Bill Bailey so sweetly that she can attend to nothing else and forgets to remove even her boots as she draws the coverlet over herself and sinks to sleep, lulled by celestial harmony. A white radiance plays on her pillow, and lights up her beautiful face. But the thunder growls again, and a lurid red glow concentrates itself on the door, which is presently flung open, revealing a saturnine figure in evening dress, partially concealed by a crimson cloak. As he steals towards the bed the unnatural glare in his eyes and the broad-bladed dagger nervously gripped in his right hand bode ill for the sleeping lady. Providentially she sneezes on the very brink of eternity, and the tension of the <per>murderer’s</per> nerves is such that he bolts precipitately under the bed at the sudden and startling <em>Atscha!</em> A dull, heavy, rhythmic thumping⁠—the beating of his heart⁠—betrays his whereabouts.
